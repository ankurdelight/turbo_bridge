== DESCRIPTION:

Ruby library for using the TurboBridge conference calling API described at http://www.turbobridge.com/api/2.0/

 * Currently supports all operations on Bridge objects only
 * Converts between API camelCase and ruby underscoring for attribute names
 * All methods raise exceptions upon failure

== SYNOPSIS:

  @bridge = TurboBridge::Bridge.create!(conference_id: conf_id, name: "My Bridge")

  @bridge = TurboBridge::Bridge.find(conf_id)

  @bridge.update_attributes!(entry_chimes: 'none')

  @bridge.destroy! or TurboBridge::Bridge.destroy!(conf_id)

== DEVELOPERS:

Note that the specs run LIVE tests against TurboBridge, and require real account info to do so; you will need to create a 'test_config.yml' file with access credentials; see test_config.yml.example for the format.

The tests will create (and if successful, clean up) a test bridge with conference ID 5555555555.
